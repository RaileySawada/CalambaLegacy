                            <h1>Procedures</h1>
                            <p>Prepare the Crust:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Mix Dry Ingredients: Combine 3 ½ cups of all-purpose flour and 1 teaspoon of fine salt in a bowl. Use a balloon whisk to mix them together.</li>
                                <li>Add Fats: Add ¼ cup cold butter and ¾ cup shortening to the flour mixture. Use a pastry mixer to blend them until the mixture becomes crumbly.</li>
                                <li>Add Water: Gradually add ½ cup ice water, one tablespoon at a time, while continuing to mix until the dough comes together.</li>
                                <li>Divide Dough: Gather the dough into a ball and divide it into two equal parts.</li>
                                <li>Roll Out Dough: On a floured surface (or a silicon mat), flatten each portion with a rolling pin until it's wide enough to fit an 8 or 9-inch cake pan.</li>
                                <li>Prepare Base Crust: Place one rolled-out dough into the cake pan to form the base. Set the second rolled-out dough aside; this will be the top crust.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Make the Filling:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Heat Milk: Pour 1 can (300ml) of sweetened condensed milk into a saucepan and bring it to a boil.</li>
                                <li>Add Sugar: Stir in 2 tablespoons of sugar.</li>
                                <li>Cook Coconut: Add 5-6 cups of young coconut meat slices and cook for 3 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Thicken Filling: Pour in a mixture of ½ cup coconut water and ½ cup flour (diluted together), stirring thoroughly. Cook until the mixture thickens.</li>
                                <li>Cool Filling: Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the filling cool down.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Assemble and Bake:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                                <li>Fill the Crust: Pour the cooled filling into the crust-lined cake pan.</li>
                                <li>Top Crust: Place the second piece of rolled-out dough over the filling and seal the edges.</li>
                                <li>Create Vents: Poke holes in the top crust using a fork to allow steam to escape.</li>
                                <li>Bake: Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the crust turns golden brown. Keep an eye on the color to ensure it's done.</li>
                                <li>Cool and Serve: Let the pie cool before serving. Enjoy and share your delicious Buko Pie!</li>

                        <h1>Espasol</h1>
                        <p>
                            Espasol is a traditional Filipino rice cake that hails from the province of Laguna. This sweet treat is particularly popular during the Christmas season. 
                            The main ingredients are rice flour, coconut milk, and sweetened coconut strips. These are cooked together until the mixture reaches a sticky consistency.
                            <br><br>
                            Once cooked, the mixture is shaped into long cylinders or triangles and coated with toasted rice flour, giving it a distinctive look and flavor. 
                            The combination of toasted glutinous rice flour and grated young coconut results in a texture that is soft, chewy, and pliable, making espasol 
                            a delightful and unique delicacy enjoyed by many.

                            Traditionally made from carabao milk, it is curdled using vinegar, citrus juices, or rennet, and seasoned with salt. Occasionally, 
                            kesong puti is also crafted from goat or cow milk, offering a slight variation in taste and texture.

                            This cheese has a mildly salty and tangy flavor, and its consistency can range from very moist to firm, depending on the preparation method. 
                            Similar in texture to queso blanco or buffalo mozzarella, kesong puti is versatile and can be enjoyed on its own, paired with bread such as pandesal, 
                            or incorporated into various Filipino dishes. Its rich, unique taste makes it a beloved delicacy in Filipino cuisine.

                                <li>Heat the Milk: In a double boiler over medium-low heat, combine 4 cups of carabao milk and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Cook for 15 minutes, stirring continuously with a sterilized spoon to prevent the mixture from boiling.</li>
                                <li>Form the Curds: Remove the milk from heat and add 1/4 cup of cane vinegar and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. Stir lightly to allow curds to form, then let the mixture cool and set for 1 hour.</li>
                                <li>Strain the Curds: Line a strainer with cheesecloth and place it over a mixing bowl. Once the mixture has cooled, pour it into the lined strainer to separate the liquid (whey) from the curds. Discard the liquid.</li>
                                <li>For Creamy Kesong Puti: Use the curds as is.</li>
                                <li>For Firmer Cheese: Place a clean, heavy object (like a small plate) on top of the curds to press out more whey.</li>
                                <li>Wrap the Curds: Place the curds on a piece of banana leaf (cut into 12x6-inch pieces and passed over an open flame). Fold the leaf to wrap the curds and tie it with kitchen twine or a long strip of banana leaf.</li>
                                <li>Store the Cheese: Place the wrapped curds in a zip-top bag or covered container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>

                        <h1>Puto</h1>
                        <p>
                            Puto, also known as Putong Bigas, is a beloved Filipino steamed rice cake made from rice dough called galapong. This treat, often referred to as 
                            putong puti due to its characteristic white color, is a staple in Filipino cuisine. Traditionally enjoyed as a merienda or snack, puto is one of the 
                            most popular types of kakanin—a category of Filipino delicacies made from glutinous rice, rice flour, and coconut.
                            <br><br>
                            Puto can be enjoyed plain, but it can also be enhanced with various toppings. A popular variation is cheese puto, which involves adding a 
                            slice of cheese on top before steaming, resulting in a simple yet delicious twist that many refer to as puto cheese. Whether enjoyed plain or 
                            with added flavors, puto remains a favorite among Filipinos for its light, fluffy texture and mildly sweet taste.

                        <h1>Monay Bae</h1>
                        <p>
                            Monay, derived from the Spanish Pan de Monja meaning "nun's bread," is a cherished Filipino bread with a rich history. This slightly sweet bun 
                            boasts a dense and heavy texture, featuring a characteristic deep partition that splits it into two distinct cheeks.
                            <br><br>
                            Often hailed as the "mother of all Filipino bread," monay serves as the foundational dough for other beloved bread varieties such as putok (star bread) 
                            and pinagong. While these breads share a similar dense texture, they each possess their own unique shapes achieved through distinctive scoring techniques. 
                            While monay is divided into two halves, putok showcases a cracked top, and pinagong is shaped like a turtle, adding to the diversity and charm of 
                            Filipino bread culture.

                            Bibingka Macapuno is a delightful Filipino delicacy that combines the traditional bibingka—a type of rice 
                            cake—with macapuno, which are soft, jelly-like coconut strings. This dessert is known for its slightly chewy 
                            texture and mildly sweet taste, often enjoyed during the Christmas season and other festive occasions.

                                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F.</li>
                                <li>In a big bowl, sift together arrowroot flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Put aside.</li>
                                <li>In another bowl, use an electric mixer to cream together the butter and sugar until it becomes creamy and fluffy.</li>
                                <li>Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
                                <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the mixing bowl, starting at low speed to moisten them and then increasing the speed until everything is fully mixed.</li>
                                <li>Beat just until the batter becomes smooth. Be careful not to overbeat.</li>
                                <li>Transfer the batter into a cookie press. Squeeze the batter onto an ungreased baking sheet in single presses, leaving about 1 and ½ inches of space between each cookie.</li>
                                <li>Bake in the preheated 350°F oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the undersides start to turn golden.</li>
                                <li>Allow the cookies to cool completely in the pan. To remove them, gently slide a cookie with your fingers until it releases. Avoid using a spatula, as the cookies are delicate and might break.</li>
