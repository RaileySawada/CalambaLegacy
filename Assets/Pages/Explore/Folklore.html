                <h1>FOLKLORE</h1>
                <p>
                    Folklore is a collection of fictional animal and human stories, as well as cultural myths, jokes, songs, 
                    tales, and even quotes. It is a description of culture that has been passed down orally from generation to generation, 
                    though many are now written down. Folklore is often known as "folk literature," or "oral traditions."

                        <h1>Legend of Calamba</h1>
                        <p>
                            The "Banga" has long been a symbol of Calamba. It is based on an oral tradition in which two Spanish soldiers ask native women 
                            about the town's name. The women, who could not understand Spanish, assumed they were asking about the clay pots they were selling and responded, 
                            "Kalan? Banga?"
                            <br><br>
                            This mythology, like many others in Laguna, depicts how "Calamba" arose from a misunderstanding between Spaniards and locals. 
                            Calamba was formed by combining the words "kalan" and "banga". However, there is a problem: a "Kalan" is a burner, whereas a "Banga" is a huge 
                            jar that is not used to cook. Filipinos refer to the "Banga" as a vessel that holds water, grains, or palm sap.
                            <br><br>
                            Some people have noticed the mismatch and now use "Clay Pot" instead of "Banga" in publications. This makes more sense given the town's icon, a massive 
                            building resembling a pot in the historic Calamba Plaza. It was created by sculptor Felipe Samaniego in 1939 and is unofficially regarded as the world's 
                            largest pot. However, it deviates from the legend's true meaning of "Banga".
                            <br><br>
                            Should we reconsider the discrepancy? Should we focus more on Calamba's history, arts, and culture? Is it time to alter the legend? 
                            Some people may be resistant to changing long-held beliefs, but is it right to continue to believe something incorrect? Isn't it worse to modify an 
                            eighty-year-old masterpiece to match a modern cityscape?

                        <h1>Legend of Pansol</h1>
                        <p>
                            Pansol is one of the barangays in the City of Calamba. From the very beginning, Pansol has been well-known. It has been a tourist destination 
                            since the time of the Spanish and even during the American era. Pansol became famous because of its natural hot springs.
                            <br><br>
                            The name Pansol comes from an early contraption or device made of bamboo or any tube inserted into a platform or side of a hill to channel 
                            water from a spring. Because of the many natural hot springs in this area of Calamba, it became customary to call it Pansol.
                            <br><br>
                            The creative minds of our ancestors eventually turned this into a story that later became a legend about the customary name Pansol. 
                            Nowadays, many people have forgotten the true meaning of the word "Pansol," and the legend is believed by many, especially the youth.
                            <br><br>
                            That's how culture evolves. It's like a mud ball rolling down the street of time, picking up whatever it encounters. 
                            Listen to the stories of Pikoy about the legend of Pansol, which connects to the name of our hero, Dr. Jose Rizal, who hails from Calamba.

                        <h1>Urban Legend: Jose Rizal is the father of Adolf Hitler</h1>
                        <p>
                            In simple terms, some made-up stories claim that Dr. Jose P. Rizal, a hero from the Philippines, was involved in strange events. 
                            One story says he was the father of Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, and another says he was a serial killer in London.
                            <br><br>
                            The first story says Rizal had a romantic relationship with Klara PÃ¶lzl, an Austrian woman, around the time Hitler was supposedly conceived. 
                            They say Rizal lost a valuable pin in Austria, which some believe was a sign of his connection to Hitler's birth. 
                            But this story doesn't make sense because Hitler was born after Rizal had already left Austria for London.
                            <br><br>
                            The second story suggests that Klara married a man named Alois Hitler, and Hitler took his stepfather's last name. 
                            But again, this doesn't match up with the dates, as Rizal wasn't in Austria when Hitler was born.
                            <br><br>
                            Overall, these stories are ridiculous and don't make sense. They lack supporting proof and are riddled with discrepancies.
